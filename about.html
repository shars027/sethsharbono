				Welcome to my site. Designed and coded by moi, with some light Javascript assistance from the lovely Shannon Mosely.<br><br>I'm an Art Director at Sony Music in New York. I currently work at Legacy â€“ usually working with previously released products. Sometimes that means reconfiguring a package to a new format. Other times it may be recreating the package when original files couldn't be located (which is very meticulous work, and I adore that kind of challenge). And then there's my favorite kind of project: making an iconic album package extra special for an anniversary reissue.<br><br>I really love music, and my favorite artists are Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus. This link to my <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/indubitably-perfect/pl.u-dA7LcBWGqGB" style="text-decoration: none; color:white"><b>'Indubitably Perfect'</b></a> playlist is a current list of all the songs that deserve your attention right now! (It really truly is a more prestigious list than the Billboard 200...)<br><br>I would love to get more opportunities creative directing holistic creative campaigns and developing cohesive art direction on everything from photoshoots, to packaging, music & lyric videos, merch, and other fan-engagement content. If you know of an opportunity or are looking for an ambitious and passionate art director, hit up that 'email me' button up top.<br><br>Chat soon ;)
