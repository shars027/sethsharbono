				This is always weird... to have to talk about myself. Here we go...<br><br>Some quick facts about myself that are probably totally irrelevant to whatever purpose has brought you to view my site.<br><br>I'm from central Minnesota. My childhood home was so secluded from the rest of the world you couldn't see another building from any direction. Of course that makes sense that a week from graduating high school I moved to New York.<br><br>I love music. I LOVE music. I LOVE MUSIC. My favorite musicians are Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus. I could go on and on about music but I think it's easier if I just share this Apple Music link to my <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/indubitably-perfect/pl.u-dA7LcBWGqGB" style="text-decoration: none; color: white;"><b>'Indubitably Perfect'</b></a> playlist with some of my current favs.<br><br>Movies are easier, The Silver Linings Playbook has been my favorite movie since I saw if for the first time. Close second is Saving Mr. Banks.<br><br>...oh and of course Star Wars.<br><br>Ok some more relevant information: I graduated from Parsons School of Design in 2020 with a Bachelors in Communication Design and minor in Culture & Media.<br><br>I have a plethora of technical skills, including photo retouching+ compositing, animation, illustration, logo design, and I dabble in HTML/CSS/Javascript... Do you like this website? Coded it myself. No Squarespace or Wix.
