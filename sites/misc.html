						Imaging Experimental Assignment &#8212; In my imaging class in college, everyone in the course drew a still life and then cut it up into tiny 1in x 1in squares. We then each had to sift through the squares and make a new image using pieces from everyones' still life.

						Personal Typography Project &#8212; When I graduated from college during the pandemic, I began to miss working on personal projects outside of work. I had found this font on Behance called Hipster Blackletter that was incomplete, and lacked consistency between letter forms. I was inspired to rebuild the font from scratch in illustrator and added my own touch to make the font feel sharper and more modern.

						Illustration Assignment &#8212; Another high school project that I was proud of, and I also love Miley Cyrus so that's why I keep it in my portfolio. In retrospect, I wouldn't have  distorted the letter forms like I did in some places on the face, but overall this was another piece that led me on the path I'm on today.

						Personal Project &#8212; When I graduated from college during the pandemic, I found myself wanting to experiment a lot more with imagery. I found this Photoshop plug-in called 'Filter Forge,' which allows you to program custom filters. I experimented around with the different components/variables available, and created this filter that takes flat black and white images and turns them into these colorful chrome images. I thought they were really beautiful and I opened up a Society6 store with the patterns I was creating with my filter.

						Imaging Assignment &#8212; In my college imaging class we made portraits inspired by different artists assigned to us. I was assigned Roy Lichtenstein. I utilized his Ben-Day Dots pattern and facial feature black lines, and then to make it my own I collaged together images from different celebrities faces to resemble me.

						Multi-Media Assignment &#8212; This one is a bit tricky to explain. In one of my studio courses in college we were paired together with a partner and had to make two portraits using unusual methods. I took photographs of each of us and split them into 4 layers of different shades. Then on 4 separate layers of paper, I cut out the different shapes. Using lyrics from songs that we felt best represented ourselves, I printed out the lyrics with different shaded backgrounds. Using a method I learned in another college course, if you douse the printed paper with a product called 'Citrasolv' and rub it against another piece of paper, you can transfer the ink; similar to how temporary tattooes work.
