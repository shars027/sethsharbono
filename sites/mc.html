						One of the biggest and longest projects I had the honor to work on at Sony Music, was the 30th Anniversary of Mariah Carey's career and the release of her first album. I was tasked with creating a logo that would brand the campaign to promote her discography, and was used on on all of her singles that were re-released. I subsequently worked on reissuing the first half of her discography on vinyl.

						Vinyl Re-Issue &#8212; Retouching & Reconstructing Original Package<br><br>Like many of these older releases, we did not have the original files for this vinyl package. I recreated the original LP by taking scans of the physical package, recoloring the images to restore color from fading due to age. I retouched each photo to remove dust and scratches, and removed all the typography from the scans. I then reset all of the copy with the original fonts that were used to make sure during this Re-Issue the packages came out look as if they were brand new.

						One of the most exciting parts of this project was that Mariah herself did an unboxing of my re-issued packages for her Instagram page. *Note* I did not work on the Christmas album that's included in this video, that package had been assembled the year prior for the 25th anniversary of her #1 'Merry Christmas' album.
